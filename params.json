  "body": "# `markdown`: a Stata module that converts Markdown to SMCL language\r\n\r\n\r\n`markdown` was originally a sub-engine of [MarkDoc](http://github.com/haghish/markdoc) package, which was used for converting \r\nMarkdown to SMCL for generating dynamic help files. However, since [GitHub package](http://github.com/haghish/package) allows \r\ninstalling package dependencies automatically, it was a time for this engine to be in a separate repository so that other \r\nusers can use it independent of [MarkDoc](http://github.com/haghish/markdoc). \r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nIf you have [GitHub package](http://github.com/haghish/package) installed, simply type:\r\n\r\n```{js}\r\ngithub install haghish/markdown\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n`markdown` takes compound double-string and it displays the SMCL text in Stata. In addition, it returns a `r(md)` macro which \r\nholds the SMCL markup code. \r\n\r\n```{js}\r\nmarkdown `\"_italic_ and __bold__\"'\r\nmarkdown `\"[Markdown Homepage](http://www.github.com/haghish/markdown)\"'\r\n```\r\n_italic_ and __bold__  \r\n[Markdown Homepage](http://www.github.com/haghish/markdown)\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n------\r\n  **E.
